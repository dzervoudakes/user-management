## Premise

Originally commissioned as a take home assessment during a job interview, I've rebuilt this project to reflect new patterns and technologies
that I've adopted over time. Also the COVID-19 pandemic was a thing, so I had some extra time on my hands... 🦠 ⏰

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Material UI
- **Backend:** Node + Express, Overnight.js
- **Database:** Docker, MongoDB
- **CI/CD:** Github Actions

## Configuration for Local Development

### Setup Database

- Ensure `Docker` is installed
- From the project root, open your terminal and run `docker-compose up`
  - Seed data for `admins` and `users` should be populated in the database automatically

## Technical Requirements
> The runtime environment for this application requires `node >= 14.6.0` and `npm >= 6.14.7`.

## Configuration
> This application makes use of `ESLint`, `Stylelint` and `EditorConfig`. Each of these features requires
> an extension be installed in order to work properly with IDEs and text editors such as VSCode.

## TODOs

- Demo `.gif`
- Notes on Server setup
- Notes on Client setup
